Carefully stick it onto the outside of the glass.\r\nStep 2: Make the Milkshake\r\nIn a blender, combine the vanilla ice cream, ½ cup milk, and ½ tsp vanilla extract.\r\nBlend until smooth and creamy. If you prefer a thicker shake, add more ice cream; for a thinner shake, add more milk.\r\nPour the prepared milkshake base into the decorated glass, filling it to about ¾ full. Set aside.\r\nPart 2: Make the Chocolate Frosted Donut\r\nStep 3: Prepare the Donut Dough\r\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg (if using).\r\nIn a separate medium bowl, whisk together the egg, ¾ cup milk, melted butter, and 1 tsp vanilla extract.\r\nPour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix with a spoon or spatula until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.\r\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes (or up to an hour) to make it easier to handle.\r\nStep 4: Cut the Donuts\r\nLightly flour a clean work surface. Turn the chilled dough out onto the floured surface.\r\nGently pat or roll the dough to about ½ inch thickness.\r\nUse a donut cutter (or a 3-inch round cutter and a 1-inch round cutter for the center hole) to cut out the donuts. You will only need one for the milkshake, but you can make more from the dough. Reroll scraps gently and cut out more donuts until all dough is used.\r\nStep 5: Fry the Donuts\r\nPour vegetable oil into a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven to a depth of about 2-3 inches. Heat the oil over medium heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C). Use a candy thermometer for accuracy.\r\nCarefully slide 1-2 donuts (don\'t overcrowd the pot) into the hot oil.\r\nFry for 1-2 minutes per side, or until golden brown.\r\nUsing a slotted spoon or spider, carefully remove the donut(s) from the oil and place them on a wire rack set over a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.\r\nStep 6: Prepare the Chocolate Glaze\r\nWhile the donut(s) are cooling slightly, in a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, 3-4 tbsp milk (start with 3 tbsp and add more if needed for desired consistency), ½ tsp vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt until smooth and lump-free.\r\nStep 7: Glaze and Decorate the Donut\r\nOnce the donut has cooled enough to handle (it should still be slightly warm), dip the top of the donut into the chocolate glaze. Allow any excess glaze to drip off.\r\nImmediately after glazing, while the glaze is still wet, dip the top of the donut into a plate of sprinkles, ensuring they stick well.\r\nPlace the glazed and sprinkled donut back on the wire rack to allow the glaze to set.\r\nPart 3: Assemble the Monster Milkshake\r\nStep 8: Final Assembly\r\nCarefully place the sprinkle-decorated chocolate donut (from Part 2) on top of the glass with the milkshake, centering it over the opening.\r\nPlace the green candy eyeball on top of the donut.\r\nInsert the paper straw into the milkshake, passing it through the donut hole.\r\nAttach the small paper bat cutout to the straw.\r\nStep 9: Serve\r\nServe immediately and enjoy your spooky monster milkshake!\r\nServing Size: 1 \r\nCalories: ~850-1000 kcal', 'uploads/monster milkshake.jpg', NULL, '2025-06-06 19:44:15'),

Add the chopped dark chocolate and vanilla extract.\r\nWhisk continuously until the chocolate is completely melted and the hot chocolate is smooth and well combined. Taste and adjust sugar if needed.\r\nStep 3: Prepare the Chocolate Whipped Cream\r\nIn a chilled bowl, combine the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and 1 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder.\r\nUsing an electric mixer or a whisk, beat the mixture on medium-high speed until soft peaks form.

Continue simmering until the milk reduces to about half its original quantity (approximately 2 cups). This process makes the kheer thick and creamy.\r\nStep 2: Prepare the Apples\r\nWhile the milk is simmering, peel, core, and finely grate the apples.\r\nIn a separate small pan, heat 1 tsp of ghee or unsalted butter over low-medium heat.\r\nAdd the grated apples and sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring continuously, until the apples soften slightly and most of their moisture evaporates. This step is crucial to prevent the kheer from curdling. Let them cool completely.\r\nStep 3: Combine and Simmer\r\nOnce the milk has reduced and the sautéed apples have cooled, add the sautéed apples to the reduced milk.\r\nAdd the granulated sugar, cardamom powder, and saffron strands (if using) to the milk-apple mixture.\r\nStir well to combine and simmer on low heat for another 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, allowing the flavors to meld.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until all the milk has been absorbed by the carrots and evaporated. This will take about 20-30 minutes. The carrots will be soft.\r\nStep 2: Sauté in Ghee\r\nOnce the milk has completely evaporated, add the ghee to the pan.\r\nIncrease the heat to medium and sauté the carrot mixture in ghee, stirring continuously for about 8-10 minutes. The carrots will start to look slightly darker and fragrant.\r\nStep 3: Add Sugar and Spices\r\nAdd the granulated sugar to the pan. As the sugar melts, it will release moisture, making the halwa a bit watery again.\r\nContinue cooking on medium heat, stirring frequently, until all the liquid from the sugar has evaporated and the halwa starts to come together and leave the sides of the pan (about 10-15 minutes).\r\nAdd the green cardamom powder and mix well.\r\nStep 4: Incorporate Khoya and Dry Fruits\r\nIf using khoya/mawa, add the crumbled khoya to the halwa and mix until it\'s well incorporated and melted into the halwa.\r\nStir in the raisins. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.\r\nStep 5: Garnish and Serve\r\nTransfer the Gajar Halwa to a serving bowl.\r\nGarnish generously with slivered or chopped almonds/pistachios.\r\nServe hot or warm.

Stop adding lemon juice once the milk has completely separated into greenish whey and solid white curds (chenna). If it doesn\'t separate, add a little more lemon juice.\r\nRemove from heat. Let it sit for 1-2 minutes.\r\nLine a colander with a clean muslin cloth or cheesecloth and place it over a large bowl. Pour the curdled milk into the colander to separate the chenna from the whey.\r\nGather the edges of the cloth and gently rinse the chenna under cold running water for 2-3 minutes. This removes any lingering lemon juice taste.\r\nSqueeze the excess water from the chenna by twisting the cloth tightly. Do not squeeze it completely dry; leave some moisture so the rasgullas remain soft. Hang it for 30-45 minutes or press it under a heavy object for 20-30 minutes to drain more water. The chenna should be crumbly but still moist.\r\nStep 2: Knead the Chenna\r\nTransfer the chenna to a wide plate or a clean work surface.\r\nKnead the chenna with the heel of your palm for 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth, soft, and lump-free. It should have a slightly greasy texture. This step is crucial for soft rasgullas.\r\nStep 3: Shape the Rasgullas\r\nDivide the kneaded chenna into 12-15 equal portions.\r\nGently roll each portion between your palms to form smooth, crack-free balls. Ensure there are no cracks, as they can cause the rasgullas to break during cooking.\r\nStep 4: Prepare the Sugar Syrup\r\nIn a large, wide pot or pressure cooker, combine the granulated sugar, 4 cups of water, and optional crushed cardamom pods and saffron strands.\r\nBring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar completely dissolves. This is a thin syrup, not a thick one.\r\nStep 5: Cook the Rasgullas\r\nOnce the sugar syrup is boiling rapidly, gently slide the prepared chenna balls into the boiling syrup. Do not overcrowd the pot; cook in batches if necessary.\r\nIf using a regular pot: Cover the pot and cook on high heat for 15-20 minutes. The rasgullas will puff up significantly. Ensure the syrup continues to boil vigorously throughout. You can gently shake the pot occasionally.\r\nIf using a pressure cooker: Close the lid (without the whistle/vent weight for the first 2-3 minutes for rapid boiling, then place the whistle), and cook on high heat for 1 whistle. Then reduce heat to low and cook for another 8-10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the pressure release naturally.\r\nStep 6: Cool and Serve\r\nOnce cooked, the rasgullas will look larger and feel spongy.\r\nLet the rasgullas cool completely in the sugar syrup. You can place the pot in an ice bath to speed up cooling.\r\nOnce cooled, transfer the rasgullas along with some syrup to a serving bowl.\r\nChill in the refrigerator for at least 2-3 hours before serving for the best taste.\r\nGarnish with slivered pistachios or saffron strands before serving.\r\nServing Size: 12-15 pieces \r\nCalories: ~150-180 kcal per piece', 'uploads/rasgulla.jpg', NULL, '2025-06-08 01:06:55'),
